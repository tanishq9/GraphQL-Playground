# If we are using HTTP as the underlying transport for our GraphQL, so client might want to send some headers in the request.
# How to access those headers and take some decision?

# For GET Mapping
type Query {
    customers: [Customer]!
    customerById(id: ID!): Customer
    createCustomer(customer: CustomerInput): Customer
}

# Using Mutation over Query is just for convention

# For POST/PUT Mapping
type Mutation {
    updateCustomer(id: ID!, customer: CustomerInput): Customer # response is updated customer
    deleteCustomer(id: ID!): DeleteResponse # return the deleted object
}

type Customer {
    id: ID!
    name: String
    age: Int
    city: String
}

input CustomerInput {
    name: String
    age: Int
    city: String
}

type DeleteResponse {
    id: ID!
    status: Status
}

enum Status {
    SUCCESS
    FAILURE
}
